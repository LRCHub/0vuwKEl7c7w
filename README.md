```lrc
[00:24.25] I am trapped inside a monster
[00:26.32] Living in a dead eternity
[00:30.10] Animated with a haunting, wanting dread
[00:33.65] To meet a spirit just like me
[00:48.15] 
[00:35.91] You're so eerily alluring
[00:38.27] Singing your foreboding melody
[00:41.81] And demanding to dote on this dancing devil
[00:44.36] Will it last?
[00:45.58] I guess we'll have to wait and see
[01:02.58] 
[00:47.99] I think you're elating
[00:49.17] A serenade so amazing
[00:50.60] You've got me craving with
[00:51.43] Outrageous adoration
[00:53.21] I can feel a shifting
[00:55.61] Surely something new emerging
[01:10.11] 
[01:00.28] I, I want your love
[01:04.70] I, I want enough
[01:10.65] I want to be part of you
[01:22.65] 
[01:24.05] Pardon me for such a silly sight
[01:27.15] Of sentimental shame
[01:29.85] As you can see, I have no use at all
[01:33.08] For love, romance or pain
[01:35.12] Oh, won't you come with me?
[01:37.42] You'll never need to choose
[01:38.63] Between your life or luxury
[01:42.08] I'll make it so you never leave
[01:57.58] 
[01:48.23] I might be a looming maniac
[01:51.20] Panicked, raving mad and more
[01:53.72] Just hold on and keep your
[01:55.63] Hands inside the ride
[01:58.38] It's worth your patience
[02:10.38] 
[02:00.17] I, I want your love
[02:04.55] I, I want enough
[02:10.69] I want to be part of you
[02:22.69] 
[02:58.44] I, I want your love
[03:04.77] I'm not gonna lie
[03:06.66] I think you might have scared her
[03:10.85] I don't think you tried
[03:12.53] To win her heart enough
[03:16.65] I guess all we've got's each other now
